# MicrOCaml
A project for CMSC330 at University of Maryland, taken in Spring 2021

In this project, I wrote a parser, lexer, and interpreter for a "new" programming language, MicrOCaml. MicrOCaml is essentially identical to the existing language OCaml, except that it implements dynamic typing as opposed to static. My work made use of context-free grammars and finite state automata to interpret user-made MicrOCaml code and translate it into equivalent OCaml code.
